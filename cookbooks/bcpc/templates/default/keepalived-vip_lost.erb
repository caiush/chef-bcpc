# Zabbix has problems running active-active HA. For example
# you can have interesting problems in the database when
# multiple zabbix servers try run house keeping.
# Also having N servers running the same checks can cause
# load prblems and confuse agents.
# For this reason this is the one place we break our
# active-active HA model. This must die.
